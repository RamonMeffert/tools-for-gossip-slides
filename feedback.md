- [ ] I like the minimalist design! 

- [ ] The phone photograph is nice but not very related. Maybe instead  you can show two agents talking to each other and merging their  secrets? 
(Attached are slides I made a while ago, maybe I sent them to you before. The people are made with tikzpeople.) 

- [ ] The numeric references are not really understandable during the  talk. You could use [Ditmarsch2018] or similar in places where  it is important, for example for [7].  But then, for example on  the (nice!) slide with four logos I think the references can  stay like this or be omitted. 

- [ ] The Example slide is more important than the notation, so maybe  even do that first and only show the example graph. Your  audience will not have enough time to read+understand formal  definitions. 

- [ ] Maybe the first "Implementation" slide should be called  "features" and Elm should only be mentioned on the slide after  that? 

- [ ] Showing the tool itself is of course important, so spend enough  time on that slide. Maybe you could even explain the features on  that slide with highlights which button relates to a feature? 

- [ ] The links on the "Thank you" slide are cool but do not work. You  probably are missing "https://" to make them absolute and not  relative. 

- [ ] Showing a demo would be nice, but then please make sure you can  fit it into the time. 

- [ ] Very nice to show the survey results! The font size in the plot  could be increased. (People have smaller screens than you and BB  collaborate will scale the slides down further.) 

- [ ] Ending with a "thank you" slide is friendly but moves the focus  away from your content. Consider using a "Summary" slide  instead. This also makes it easier for the audience to think  about what they saw and what they could ask a good question  about. 

- [ ] Whether to use \pause a lot is a matter of taste
