## What is Gossip?

(Image of gossiping people?)

- Original problem: how many calls does it take for a group of friends to share all their gossips?
  - Attributed to A.V. Boyd, but might be R. Chesters & S. Silverman (all @ University of Witwatersrand). Or even ErdÅ‘s.
- No fewer than 2n - 4 calls for n >= 2 (Baker & Shostak, 1972; Hajnal et al., 1972; Lebensold, 1973; Tijdeman, 1971)
  - Maybe even before 1966 (J. Spencer & R.T. Bumby).
